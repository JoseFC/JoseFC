- Who am I?  Born and raised in Buenos Aires, got a true multicultural upbringing between both the Anglo and Spanish cultures. Fortunate to spend part of the childhood at the family "estancia" (ranch) which provided a good mix of country and big-city cultures. Unrelentingly curious and a bookworm from an early age, soon realized that neither singing nor law provided full career satisfaction, ended up working (and travelling the world) in the maritime industry for over 20 years until 2010, when it became possible to indulge full time in that entrepreneurial vocation. Law Degree from the Universidad de Buenos Aires, MBA from Oxford University, and Doctor of Education from University of Miami ... now working/teaching/studying AI at Miami Dade College. As a university professor for over a decade I'm always learning!
